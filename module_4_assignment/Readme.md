- Create all files in *module_4_assignment* package




### Assignment 1: Energy-Efficient Path Planning Node
- **Tasks**:
Write a ROS2 node that plans the TurtleBot3's path to a given goal while minimizing energy consumption based on time.
The path planning algorithm should consider both the distance to the goal and the robot's energy expenditure, which could be simulated based on speed, acceleration, and distance traveled.

### Assignment 2: Multi-Robot Coordination in a Shared Environment
- **Tasks**:
Develop a scenario in Gazebo where multiple TurtleBot3 robots must perform a task cooperatively (e.g. forming shapes ).
Write ROS2 nodes that enable each robot to communicate and coordinate with each other to achieve the common goal without collisions.
