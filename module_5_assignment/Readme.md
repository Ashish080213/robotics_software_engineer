# Assignments for Module #6 : Path Planning Algorithms
- Create all files in *module_6_assignment* package

### Assignment 1: Implementing and Visualizing Breadth-First Search (BFS) in Rviz
- **Tasks**:
Develop a grid-based map in Rviz representing an environment with obstacles.
Implement the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from a start point to a goal point, avoiding obstacles.
Increase the size of Rviz Map and also place obstacle by filling cells.
### Assignment 2: Depth-First Search (DFS) for Maze Solving
- **Tasks**:
Create a maze as a grid in Rviz, with walls and a clear start and end point.
Write a ROS2 node that applies DFS to explore and find a path through the maze.
Visualize the search progression and the solution path, highlighting dead ends and the final successful route.
### Assignment 3: Dijkstra’s Algorithm for Weighted Pathfinding
- **Tasks**:
Design a grid map in Rviz with varying terrain types, each having different traversal costs.
Develop a ROS2 node that uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the least costly path from start to goal.
Visualize both the search process and the optimal path, showing how different terrain costs affect the route.
